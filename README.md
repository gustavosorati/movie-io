    This a project development for study and portfolio Next.js. The Project is still in development and some changes may occur.

I wanted something to be able to work with the next.js api routes consuming data and working with that data with its own backend.
So I decided to make a project that fetches data from the TMDB API and uses nextAuth using the google provider, to be able to favorite movies so that they can be saved in a database.

It was a very fun project and with many learnings.
